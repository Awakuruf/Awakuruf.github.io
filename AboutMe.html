                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <h4>My name is Daichi Furukawa. I'm currently in my third year at University of British Columbia, studying Cognitive Systems under the field of Computer Science.
                    This website is created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to display my work I've done throughout my Undergrad years and experiences I've gained from different areas of work.
                    One of the biggest reason why I decided to study in the field of Cognitive System rather than pure Computer Science was because of my interest in the concept of AI and how one can implement an artificial intelligence based off what already exists in our world as a "natural intelligence".
                    </h4>
                    <h2>Background of my life</h2>
                    <h4>Soccer has been part of my life ever since I immigrated to Canada from Japan. The transition was unimaginably difficult simply due to the fact that I couldn’t speak a word of English. I was blindly thrown into a Grade 3 classroom full of Canadian students speaking their native language. Back in Japan, I was surrounded by friends, but due to the language barrier I was completely isolated in school. During this harsh period, I discovered soccer. What got me into soccer was that it didn’t require speaking because your actions spoke for themselves. Only few phrases were required with the addition of body languages in order to communicate. Gradually, I was able to gain recognition among my classmates, which gave me the confidence to speak up. Really throughout soccer, I learnt how to be myself with others through simply playing Soccer and obstacles like language barrier was simply a problem that can be mitigated by coming up with an adaptable solution which is what I came to as a realization.</h4>
                    <h2>My passion toward AI Development</h2>
                    <h4>Ever since the discovery of a simple visual programming language “Scratch” in early high school, I’ve grown an interest toward solving systematic problems, which compelled me to think beyond the objective. I was intrigued by the concept of Artificial intelligence ever since my programming teacher encouraged me to participate in a local technology fair called BCTECHSummit. Here, I had the opportunity to learn in-depth mechanics within robotics and blueprinting of AIs, which further pushed my interest.</h4>
